# Changelog

All notable changes to SlashLootr. Dates are YYYY-MM-DD.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-29

**Built to sit inside somebody else's modpack.** Almost everything here is SlashLoot learning to do
less: leaving containers it does not own alone, handing blacklisted loot back to vanilla, letting
chests behave like chests. And it now runs on NeoForge, across every version Fabric already had.

Thanks to **TheArchictect** on CurseForge, who reported four of these.

### Containers SlashLoot does not own are left alone

- **Blacklisted dimensions and loot tables no longer serve empty containers.** If you put a
  dimension or a loot table on a blocklist, that container now behaves exactly as it would with
  SlashLoot uninstalled: shared vanilla loot, working hoppers, working comparators. Previously the
  blocklist stopped SlashLoot from serving the container but did not stop it from suppressing the
  vanilla roll, so nobody filled it and it stayed empty forever.
- **Modded containers are no longer broken by association.** The vanilla method SlashLoot hooks is
  shared by every container type in the game, including ones from other mods that it has no idea how
  to serve. Those are now left completely untouched. If you *want* SlashLoot to instance unknown
  modded containers, set `handleUnknownContainers: true`.
- **Container size is read from the container** instead of being assumed to be 27 slots, so a modded
  chest with a different inventory size gets a personal copy of the right shape.

### Chests behave like chests again

- **Lids animate.** Chest and shulker lids open, barrels flip their `open` state, and both halves of
  a double chest animate together. The open sound now comes from vanilla, so it plays once.
- **Trapped chests emit redstone again.** This had been silently broken since 0.1.0.
- Turn it off with `delegateContainerAnimation: false` if it conflicts with something.

### It cleans up after itself

Stored loot for a container is dropped when that container is destroyed, so a long-running server
does not accumulate dead entries. Three layers cover the ways a container can vanish: breaking it,
destroying the minecart or boat carrying it, and a low-cost background sweep that catches
explosions, pistons, and world edits. Tune with `cleanupOnBreak`, `pruneIntervalTicks`, and
`pruneBatchSize`.

### You can ask it what it decided

Set `debugLogging: true` and SlashLoot logs one line per container: position, loot table, whether it
served a personal copy or handed the container to vanilla, and why.

```
[SlashLoot] block chest @ minecraft:overworld [123,64,-45] table=minecraft:chests/simple_dungeon -> INSTANCE reason=instanced slots=27
[SlashLoot] block minecraft:hopper @ minecraft:overworld [110,-60,100] table=minecraft:chests/village/village_weaponsmith -> VANILLA reason=unsupported_container:minecraft:hopper
```

Repeat verdicts are deduplicated, so hopper polling cannot flood the log. Built for exactly the job
of working out why a container in a big pack behaves the way it does.

### NeoForge, and Minecraft 26.2

- **NeoForge builds** for 1.20.6, 1.21 through 1.21.1, 1.21.2 through 1.21.3, 1.21.4, 1.21.5,
  1.21.6 through 1.21.8, 1.21.9 through 1.21.10, 1.21.11, 26.1.2, and 26.2. Same mod, same
  behaviour, same save data.
- **Minecraft 26.2** on both loaders.
- JARs are now named `slashlootr-<version>+mc<band>-<loader>.jar`. Mind the suffix when you pick one.

Two gaps worth knowing about, both outside our control: NeoForge has no 1.20.1 or 1.20.5 line, so
Fabric covers those alone; and NeoForge has published no stable 21.6, 21.7 or 21.9 build, so
Minecraft 1.21.6 through 1.21.8 and 1.21.9 through 1.21.10 are served by the 21.8 and 21.10 builds.

### Version coverage correction

**If you run Minecraft 1.21.5 on Fabric, the old download did not work and you should take the new
1.21.5 file.** Releases up to 0.1.2 advertised the 1.21.4 JAR as covering 1.21.5. It never could:
Minecraft removed the save-data API that build relies on at 1.21.5, one version earlier than the
metadata assumed. 1.21.5 now has its own build on both loaders.

### New commands

`/slashloot forget all` now works (it previously printed instructions to stop the server and delete
a file by hand). Also new: `/slashloot prune`, `/slashloot stats`, and `/slashloot reload`.

### Config

Every key is optional and defaults sensibly, so a config file from an older version keeps working.
`/slashloot reload` re-reads it without a restart.

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "dimensionBlocklist": [],
  "lootTableBlocklist": [],
  "handleUnknownContainers": false,
  "delegateContainerAnimation": true,
  "playOpenCloseSounds": true,
  "cleanupOnBreak": true,
  "pruneIntervalTicks": 6000,
  "pruneBatchSize": 256,
  "debugLogging": false
}
```

Mod id, config path, and the per-dimension save file are unchanged, so existing server data carries
over untouched.

### Under the hood

- The nine per-band source forks are gone. Every band from 1.20.5 up now compiles one shared source
  tree plus small per-generation compatibility shims, so a fix is written once instead of nine
  times. 1.20.1 stays a documented fork; it predates the interfaces the rest of the tree relies on.
- That shared tree is loader-neutral behind a single seam, which is why NeoForge needed one adapter
  and no changes to the mod logic or the mixins at all.
- The 26.1.2 mixin config now declares JAVA_25, matching the JDK it is compiled with. It was
  shipping JAVA_21.
- Break cleanup no longer trusts the break event. NeoForge fires its version before the break and
  allows it to be cancelled, unlike Fabric, so the position is re-checked a tick later instead of
  being dropped on faith.

### Verified

Band 1.21.1 was checked end to end on both loaders: instanced containers, blacklist fallback,
unsupported-container fallback, commands, config reload, and decision logging. All 22 band and
loader combinations build clean.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-05-31

Branding pass: the project is now published as **SlashLoot** to keep the listing distinct and unambiguous.

### Changed

- **Admin command renamed `/slashlootr` → `/slashloot`** across all bands, to match the new project name.
- Command feedback messages now prefixed `SlashLoot:` instead of `SlashLootr:`.
- **License is now CC-BY-4.0** (was MIT) — `LICENSE`, every band's `fabric.mod.json`, and the listing descriptions updated to match.
- Listing descriptions (Modrinth/CurseForge) and README rewritten to remove third-party-mod comparisons.

### Unchanged (intentionally)

- Mod id, package, config file (`config/slashlootr.json`), and the per-dimension save file (`world/<dim>/data/slashlootr.dat`) keep the `slashlootr` identifier so existing server data is preserved across the update.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-25

Two new bands covering Mojang's late-2025 / early-2026 rename storm.

### Added

- **Band F: MC 1.21.11** — picks up the renames Mojang shipped at 1.21.11 that broke Band E on that version:
  - `net.minecraft.world.entity.vehicle.ChestBoat` → `…vehicle.boat.ChestBoat`
  - `net.minecraft.world.entity.vehicle.MinecartChest` → `…vehicle.minecart.MinecartChest`
  - `net.minecraft.world.entity.vehicle.MinecartHopper` → `…vehicle.minecart.MinecartHopper`
  - `net.minecraft.world.entity.vehicle.AbstractMinecartContainer` → `…vehicle.minecart.AbstractMinecartContainer`
  - `ResourceLocation` → `Identifier` (renamed in place at `net.minecraft.resources`)
  - `ResourceKey#location()` → `ResourceKey#identifier()`
  - `Level#random` (field) → `Level#getRandom()` (method)
  - `CommandSourceStack#hasPermission(int)` → `Commands.hasPermission(Commands.LEVEL_GAMEMASTERS)` predicate
  - `SimpleContainer.addListener` removed → replaced with a `DirtyContainer extends SimpleContainer` that overrides `setChanged()` to mark the SavedData dirty
  - `SavedDataType` first arg still `String` (changes to `Identifier` in 26.1)
- **Band G: MC 26.1.2 ("Tiny Takeover")** — same rename surface as Band F plus:
  - **Quarantined**: own Gradle 9.4 wrapper, Loom 1.15.5, JDK 25 toolchain. Lives under `versions/26.1.2/` with its own gradlew. Main composite shells out via the `build26` task.
  - **Unobfuscated**: no `mappings loom.officialMojangMappings()` — Mojang names ship directly.
  - `SavedDataType` first arg now `Identifier` (via `Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath`).
  - `SeedDeriver` inlined into the band's package since the main composite's `:common` subproject isn't reachable from the quarantine.

### Changed

- **Loom bumped 1.11 → 1.13.6** across the main composite. Verified backwards-compatible with Bands A through E. Required to add 1.21.11 as a regular subproject.
- **Band E (1.21.9) coverage narrowed** in publish scripts: was claimed to cover 1.21.9–1.21.11; now claims only 1.21.9 and 1.21.10 since 1.21.11 needs Band F's rename surface.
- **`build.gradle` root**: added `build26` `Exec` task and a quarantined-libs collect step in `buildAll` so the 10 JARs land together in `build/release/`.

### Runtime verified

- Band C (1.21.1): verified with two players on two machines.
- Bands A, B, D, E, F, G: compile-clean only.

---

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-24

Initial implementation. Eight Minecraft version bands shipping out of the gate.

### Added

**Core mechanic** (all bands)
- Server-side per-player instanced loot for naturally-generated containers. Each player who opens a chest with a `LootTable` NBT tag receives a freshly-rolled personal inventory; one player's looting leaves the chest full for everyone else.
- Hook 1: mixin on the vanilla loot-roll method cancels the "lazy bake into the world container" pass — the chest's `LootTable` and `LootTableSeed` NBT tags stay intact across server restarts.
- Hook 2: Fabric `UseBlockCallback` + `UseEntityCallback` intercept right-click before vanilla menu-creation runs, build (or load) a per-player `SimpleContainer`, and open a vanilla `ChestMenu` / `ShulkerBoxMenu` / `HopperMenu` backed by it.
- Per-player loot seed: `containerSeed XOR player.uuid.msb XOR rotL(player.uuid.lsb, 17)` — same player + same container = same loot across re-opens.

**Container coverage**
- Chests, trapped chests, barrels, shulker boxes (block containers).
- Chest minecarts, hopper minecarts, chest boats (entity containers).
- Double chests: each half tracks its own per-player loot independently; opening either half presents a combined 54-slot `CompoundContainer` view, canonicalized by lower-packed `BlockPos`.

**Persistence**
- `world/<dimension>/data/slashlootr.dat`. Two top-level maps: `blocks` (keyed by packed `BlockPos`) and `entities` (keyed by entity UUID). Survives server restart.
- `ContainerListener` on every personal `SimpleContainer` marks the `SavedData` dirty on any slot change.

**Admin & config**
- `/slashlootr forget here|at <pos>|player <name>` (op-only).
- `config/slashlootr.json` with `dimensionBlocklist`, `lootTableBlocklist`, `playOpenCloseSounds`.

**Multi-version build infrastructure**
- Multi-project Gradle build patterned on `slashdaemon/TipSign`. `common/` holds version-agnostic logic (just `SeedDeriver`); each band under `versions/<MC>/` is a self-contained subproject.
- `./gradlew buildAll` produces 8 JARs in `build/release/`.

### Per-band specifics

> See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` § Per-band specifics](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#per-band-specifics) for full file-level diffs.

| Band | MC versions | Loom | Java | Notable rewrites vs. 1.21.1 baseline |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| **A** | 1.20.1 | 1.11.x | 17 | `RandomizableContainer` interface didn't exist — mixin targets `RandomizableContainerBlockEntity` class. `ContainerEntity` interface didn't exist — split into separate `MixinAbstractMinecartContainer` + `MixinChestBoat`. Loot-table fields are private — added three `@Accessor` mixins (`AccessorRandomizableContainerBlockEntity`, `AccessorAbstractMinecartContainer`, `AccessorChestBoat`). `ResourceLocation` everywhere (no `ResourceKey<LootTable>`). `SavedData.computeIfAbsent(loader, factory, id)` 3-arg form, `save(CompoundTag)` without `HolderLookup.Provider`. `SimpleContainer.fromTag/createTag` without `HolderLookup.Provider`. |
| **B** | 1.20.5 | 1.11.x | 21 | Same source as Band C — compiles clean because 1.20.5 introduced `RandomizableContainer` interface, `ContainerEntity` interface, `ResourceKey<LootTable>`, and `HolderLookup.Provider` parameters. |
| **C** | 1.21, 1.21.1 | 1.11.x | 21 | The baseline. 1.21 shares 1.21.1's source tree via `sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs`. |
| **D** | 1.21.2, 1.21.4 | 1.11.x | 21 | `ContainerEntity.getLootTable()` → `getContainerLootTable()` (and the seed equivalent). Two-method rename in `EntityInteractionHandler` + `MixinContainerEntity`. |
| **E** | 1.21.6, 1.21.9 | 1.11.x | 21 | `SavedData.Factory<T>` removed; `SavedDataType<T>` + `Codec<T>` is the only registration path. Rewrote `SlashLootrState` with `RecordCodecBuilder` and a sparse `SlotItem(int slot, ItemStack item)` codec (encodes only non-empty slots). `PlayerLootEntry` lost its NBT methods in favor of a codec helper. |

### Build infrastructure

- Loom bumped from 1.9 → 1.10 → 1.11 as needed for newer MC versions.
- Fabric API versions per band cross-referenced against `slashdaemon/TipSign` and Modrinth's Fabric API release list.

### Not yet implemented

- Chest lid animation (open sound plays via `OpenSoundFx`, but the lid stays closed because we bypass `ContainerOpenersCounter`).
- `/slashlootr forget all` — currently emits an error suggesting the admin stop the server and delete `slashlootr.dat`.
- Decorated pots and suspicious sand/gravel (different open mechanic — brushing — would need separate hooks).
- Looted-state visual indicator (Lootr's gold→blue color change would require a companion client mod).
- Loot decay / re-roll (each player's loot is currently permanent by design).
- Runtime verification on LocalServer or a production deploy — code is compile-clean only.
